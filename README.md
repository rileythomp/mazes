# mazes

Maze Server for https://solvergenerators.herokuapp.com written in Go.

Implements 11 different maze generation algorithms. More than 100,000 mazes were generated for feature comparison between algorithms.

This [paper](https://hal.uca.fr/hal-03174952/document) is relevant and similar to a lot of the work I did here.
